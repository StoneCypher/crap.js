Warning to NPM users!
---------------------

This isn't even starting on being ready yet.  At this point it's little more 
than a gulpfile and a package.  I wouldn't have filed this yet, except that some
of what I'm doing means this needs to be on `npm` for testing.





Requirements
------------

`node.js` >= 0.9 (because of `minimist`)
